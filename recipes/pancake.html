        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A pancake is a breakfast dish, a flat cake that's made by pouring batter into a hot pan and frying it on both sides. Many people like to eat their pancakes with a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3.5 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1.25 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tbsp butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
